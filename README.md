# Formula Concept Retrieval for Mathematical Entity Linking (MathEL).

This repository contains data, and algorithms for Formula Concept Discovery (FCD) and Formula Concept Recognition (FCR) experiments presented in the journal paper 'Discovery and Recognition of Formula Concepts using Machine Learning' by Scharpf, Schubotz, and Gipp.

In this paper, we suggest how mathematical formulas could be cited and define a 'Formula Concept Retrieval' task with two subtasks: Formula Concept Discovery (FCD) and Formula Concept Recognition (FCR). While FCD aims at the definition and exploration of a 'Formula Concept' that names bundled equivalent representations of a formula, FCR is designed to match a given formula to a prior assigned unique mathematical concept identifier. We present Machine Learning based approaches to address the FCD and FCR tasks. We then evaluate these approaches on a standardized test collection (NTCIR arXiv dataset). Our FCD approach yields a precision of 68% for retrieving equivalent representations of frequent formulas and a recall of 72% for extracting the formula name from the surrounding text. FCD and FCR enable the citation of formulas within mathematical documents and facilitate semantic search and question answering as well as document similarity assessments for plagiarism detection or recommender systems.
